Welcome to my professional cybersecurity portfolio. Below, you will find a collection of my work, displaying home labs, HTB Sherlocks, SIEM tools, DFIR tools, and more, demonstrating my hands-on experience in the field. I am currently seeking a position where I can leverage my Blue Team skills and contribute to the evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Eager to join a forward-thinking organization, I look forward to applying my knowledge in threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring to help strengthen cybersecurity defenses.

# Projects
## **Azure Honeypot Detection Lab (Microsoft Sentinel)**


**Tools & Stack:**
  Azure Virtual Machine (Windows 10 Pro)
  Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)
  Log Analytics Workspace
  Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4625)
  KQL (Kusto Query Language)
  GeoIP Enrichment + Attack Heatmap
  

### Professional Statement

I'm building real-world defensive security skills, cloud logging, threat detection, and incident response. This home lab showcases my ability to configure and analyze in Azure environments using Sentinel and KQL to visualize attacker data.


## Project Overview

| Phase             | What I Did |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Deployment**    | Deployed a public Windows VM honeypot, deliberately exposing it to brute-force attempts by disabling default firewall rules and inviting attacker activity |
| **Data Collection** | Captured failed login attempts (Event ID 4625), shipped logs to Sentinel via Azure Monitor Agent |
| **Threat Correlation** | Built a GeoIP watchlist CSV and used KQL to enrich log data with attacker IP, city, country, and geo‑coordinates |
| **Visualization**  | Created an attack map workbook in Sentinel to display geolocated threat sources in near-real time |
| **Outcomes**       | Detected unauthorized login attempts from global regions (ex: Russia), practiced detection engineering, SIEM configuration, and incident workflow |


## Skills & Learnings
- Azure cloud architecture and honeypot setup  
- Microsoft Sentinel configuration and log forwarding  
- Advanced KQL queries: conditional filters, geo enrichment, projection, summaries  
- Threat detection and attribution via failed login correlation  
- Mapping attacker patterns to real IP geography  
- Incident reporting: identifying IOCs, providing mitigation, outlining proactive measures


## Visualization Output
Here’s a sample of the attack map generated in Sentinel using enriched GeoIP telemetry:

## Real-time Visual
This is a prime example of a attacker named "marco" trying to access my workstation. He or she is seen trying to log in to my vm. When i look up their IP Address. I get the location of *Russia, Saint-Petersburg*.

## KQL query
To view the data we can go back to our Logs table we can query for specific geo locations. using the provided query:

```kql
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent
    | where IpAddress == "xx.xx.xx.xx"
    | where EventID == 4625
    | order by TimeGenerated desc
    | evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network);
WindowsEvents
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, AttackerIp = IpAddress, cityname, countryname, longitude, latitude
```
This query extracts failed login attempts tied to a User conor external IP address *the attacker who tried to login*. This query correlates these events with a GeoIP watchlist, and outputs relevant metadata such as host machine, timestamp, and geolocation of the attack source.

The picture below is a KQL query that i imported to help specify the countryname, cityname, statename and etc. of each corresponding IP address
