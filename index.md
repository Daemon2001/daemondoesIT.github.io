# HTB Sherlocks 

HTB Sherlocks is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed for Blue Teamers. It presents real-world security scenarios and provides related files for analysis. As security analysts, our task is to investigate these casesâ€”whether by performing Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) to uncover missing files or analyzing Splunk alerts for potential threats.

Below, you'll find my progress and solutions for the Sherlock Labs.

Campfire -  (DFIR Sherlock)
Date Investigated: 03/20/2025
Tools Used: Event Viewer, Timeline Explorer

## Scenario 
Alonzo Spotted Weird files on his computer and informed the newly assembled SOC Team. Assessing the situation it is believed a Kerberoasting attack may have occurred in the network. It is your job to confirm the findings by analyzing the provided evidence. You are provided with: 1- Security Logs from the Domain Controller 2- PowerShell-Operational Logs from the affected workstation 3- Prefetch Files from the affected workstation

Task 1: Analyzing Domain Controller Security Logs, can you confirm the date & time when the kerberoasting activity occurred?
Answer: 2024-05-21 03:18:09
### Explanation
To find kerberoasting activity, I started off by searching for Event ID 4768. Event ID 4768 is logged on the Domain Controllers (DC), and tracks failed or successful instances of kerberoasting. Shown below you will see I found a account with a different service name from the standard "DC$", as well as the Ticket Encryption Type being 0x17.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>

<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
